        <p> Daniel's journey into the tech world began when he saved up his money he made from Content creating 
          on Youtube to build his first computer.
          Instead of just using it for playing games and watching videos, 
          he quickly delved into the intricacies of the machine, 
          exploring its hardware and software components with an insatiable thirst for knowledge.</p>
        <p>I've discovered that formal education is not the only path to success in this dynamic and ever-evolving field. I am a self-taught developer, 
          eager to learn and adapt to the latest trends and technologies.</p>
